# 📖 LLM Data Glossary: Definitions & Terms

This document serves as the technical reference for the **Data Radar and Acquisition** phase. It defines the metrics used to evaluate dataset quality and the techniques used to refine raw data into "model-ready" tokens.

---


## 📊 Volume & Architectural Metrics
| Term | Definition | Impact on Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Token Scale** | The total volume of atomic text units (tokens) in a dataset. | Defines the knowledge "depth." Foundations require Trillion-scale; specialized sets require Million/Billion-scale. |
| **General Pretraining Share** | The % of the total training "mixture" allocated to a specific dataset. | Controls the "personality" of the model. Usually **40–50%** for general base data to prevent over-specialization. |
| **Dataset Reduction** | The % of data discarded during the cleaning phase. | A high reduction rate (e.g., 30-40%) is often a sign of high-quality, aggressive filtering. |
| **Raw Pool Removed** | The specific volume of the initial raw "crawl" that was discarded before tokenization. | Measures the "noise" level of the original source; helps in auditing the efficiency of the scraper. |
| **Foundation Suitability** | A rating (1-5) of how well a dataset can build core reasoning and logic from scratch. | Based on the inclusion of code, math, and high-quality academic reasoning. |

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Refinement Techniques
| Technique | How it Works | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MinHash Deduplication** | Uses probabilistic "fingerprints" to find and remove documents that are nearly identical. | Eliminates "near-duplicates" (e.g., the same news article on 50 different websites). |
| **Perplexity Filtering** | Uses a small "judge" model to score text; if the text is gibberish or nonsensical, it receives a high score and is deleted. | Removes "junk" text, SEO spam, and incoherent web scrapes. |
| **Repetitive Header Removal** | Strips recurring boilerplate like navigation menus, "Sign In" buttons, and legal footers. | Prevents the model from learning "website UI" components instead of actual language. |
| **Bloom Filter Filtering** | A space-efficient data structure used to check if a specific piece of data has been seen before. | Used for high-speed deduplication across massive (Trillion-token) datasets. |

## 🛡️ Trust, Quality & Risk Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Critical Threshold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Post-filter Contamination** | The % of evaluation benchmark questions (test answers) that leaked into the training data. | **Target: <1%**. High contamination results in "fake" benchmark scores (cheating). |
| **Indic Strength** | The depth and accuracy of coverage for the 22+ official Indian languages. | Essential for ensuring the model respects regional linguistic nuances. |
| **Licensing Clarity** | The legal transparency and usage rights of the data source. | **Low Risk:** CC-0/Public Domain. **High Risk:** Copyrighted textbooks or private data. |
